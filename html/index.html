    <h2>How I started</h2>
        <p>     I graduated with a degree in anthropology and shortly after took an interest in UX design and research. Being an anthropologists, research came to me naturally and I was able to pick up on a lot of the interviewing, data analysis, and taking instances into context when validating a design choice throught the lens of UX. In pursuing my passion of social research, along with my newly found interest in design. A mixture of self-teaching myself and taking UI/UX bootcamp from Northwestern I began developing my skills in human-centered design, coding, and becoming a researcher that asks the right questions and I haven’t looked back since. 
        </p>
    <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
        <p>    Currently, I would label myself as a curious and thorough designer, overall I’d consider myself a design anthropologist and much of my work is UX related. I am often reading on different applications of UX enjoy consuming articles that people write on their experiences in UX while building upon my own experiences. I am well versed in the UX design process and have done a few website redesigns, mobile prototyping, user researching, and even some front-end development. I work as a UX designer for VUIs for a company utilizing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems. </p>
    <h2>Where I am looking towards.</h2>
    <p>    Looking towards the future, I am interested in doing freelance work for the time being, with a focus in web or mobile applications. I am relatively flexible in where I’d like to apply my strengths, so feel free to contact me if anything from the above interests you.</p>
